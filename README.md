To recreate our car, first install donkeycar with the tutorial on www.donkeycar.com and replace the files manage.py, myconfig.py and camera.py with the files found on this repository. The files will be in the directory created with the command "donkey createcar ~/mycar", where the directory can be chosen freely.
